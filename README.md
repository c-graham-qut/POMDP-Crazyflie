# Implementation of POMDP using Bitcraze Crazyflie Drones

## Software Toolkit
For more information on the POMDP model used please visit -> [TAPIR POMDP - Master](https://github.com/RDLLab/tapir)

### Creators
TAPIR [1] is a C++ implementation of the Adaptive Belief Tree (ABT) algorithm [2]. ABT is an online POMDP solver capable of adapting to modifications to the POMDP model without the need to reconstruct the policy from scratch. For continuous action spaces, TAPIR also includes an implementation of General Pattern Search in Adaptive Belief Trees (GPS-ABT) [3].
